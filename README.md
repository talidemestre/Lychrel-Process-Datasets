# Lychrel-Process-Datasets
A series of jupyter notebook files investigating the nature of Lychrel numbers and their strange behaviour, including activities such as processing digit distributions and hunting for larger Lyschrel seeds than have currently been identified.  
  
Datasets for the investigation of Lychrel numbers will be hosted on Google Drive, this is the notebook code for generating and formatting the datasets.
